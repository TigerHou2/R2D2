# R2D2

Since December 2020, we have been working on building a 3D-printed, life-sized, remote-controlled R2D2. Here is a video of our current progress!

We would like to acknowledge the sources for this project. We used [Mr. Baddeley's](https://www.patreon.com/mrbaddeley) files to print the body for R2D2 and based our circuit designs around sources found on [Astromech.net](https://astromech.net/). This repo is used for software prototyping and documentation, so there will not be enough information from here alone for you to build your own astromech. Consult the sources above or contact us if you are interested!
